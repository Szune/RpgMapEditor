RpgMapEditor

Disclaimer: I've had requests to make my old 2D map editor open source, it was sloppily coded a few years back when I didn't know better.
The project is also literally copied from code I wrote for the game it was supposed to be used for, so a lot of classes are not even used in this project.

Editor code is in Editor.cs (huge surprise there), UI code is in Modules\Controls (UI is entirely written by me, it's also not an example of great code)

Artwork I used in the video showcasing it: https://elysianfieldsrpg.wordpress.com/about/

Improvements:
- Can now place tiles by holding down the mouse button instead of clicking it every time
- Dragging the map by right clicking is now smoother in the top left corner

Files essential to starting the map editor:
- All files in Content\Graphics\UI
- All _files_ in Content\ 
- All _folders_ in Content\
- At least 1 spritesheet file in Content\Creatures, Content\Items, Content\Tiles
- Content\scripts\sprites.lua (every lua table needs at least one entry)
